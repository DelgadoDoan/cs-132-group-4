    <h1>Discussion and Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
        This study aimed to understand how household spending on education in the Philippines changed from 2000 to 2025, 
        how it relates to the education sector's Gross Value Added (GVA), and how major national crises affected these patterns.
        By combining exploratory data analysis, statistical correlation, and an Interrupted Time-Series Analysis (ITSA), 
        the project provided a clear picture of long-term spending behavior and its economic significance.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
            The main goal of our research was to determine whether Filipino household spending on education has grown over time 
            and whether this spending is meaningfully connected to the economic performance of the education sector. 
            We also examined how major crises, including Typhoon Yolanda (2013) and the COVID-19 pandemic (2020), interrupted or reshaped these spending patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
            The exploratory data analysis (EDA) provided the first important insights. From 2000 to 2025, household education spending 
            increased from about <strong>₱70 billion</strong> to nearly <strong>₱250 billion</strong>, showing a long-term upward trend. 
            The distribution plots revealed that both HFCE and GVA were positively skewed, which meant that a log transformation was necessary 
            before applying statistical tests. This step helped normalize the data and improve the reliability of our results.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the machine learning and statistical component, we used two analytical approaches: 
            <strong>Pearson's correlation</strong> (a statistical ML-based measure for linear association) and 
            <strong>OLS-based Interrupted Time-Series Analysis (ITSA)</strong>. 
            These methods allowed us to measure both long-term relationships and crisis-specific disruptions.
            Pearson's correlation produced strong positive results in both raw and log-transformed data, 
            with coefficients of <strong>0.8863</strong> (raw) and <strong>0.9203</strong> (log-transformed) and extremely small p-values 
            (<strong>3.2554e-35</strong> and <strong>1.4949e-42</strong>, respectively). 
            These values clearly show that as household spending increases, the GVA of the education sector also increases.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Interrupted Time-Series Analysis (ITSA) using <strong>Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)</strong> regression provided a deeper view 
            into how national crises affected spending. Results showed a temporary decline of about 
            <strong>₱4 billion</strong> after Typhoon Yolanda and a much larger drop of <strong>₱25-30 billion</strong> during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
            However, both disruptions were followed by strong recoveries, with spending projected to return to approximately 
            <strong>₱230 billion</strong> by 2025.

        <p>
        Together, these findings demonstrate a consistent narrative: Filipino households continuously invest in education, 
        even during economic downturns, and their spending significantly contributes to the sector's overall productivity.

        <h2>Limitation and Next Steps</h2>

        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>
            While the analysis provides strong evidence, it also has limitations. 
            First, the data relied on national-level aggregates, meaning household-level differences (income, region, school type) were not captured.  
            Second, ITSA assumes linear recovery patterns, which may oversimplify real-world post-crisis behavior.  
            Third, the analysis focused only on HFCE and GVA; factors such as inflation, tuition policy changes, or demographic shifts were not modeled.  
            Finally, future years beyond 2025 are based on projections, which naturally carry uncertainty.
        </p>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>
            To strengthen the findings, future studies could incorporate household survey data, inflation-adjusted spending, 
            and additional economic indicators.  
            A multivariate forecasting model (ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM) could also more accurately capture future spending trends.  
            Expanding the dataset to include regional differences would provide a richer understanding of inequality in education spending. 
            Lastly, combining this economic data with educational outcomes (test scores, enrollment, completion rates) 
            could reveal how spending translates to learning improvements.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            This research demonstrates several important findings. First, household spending on education in the Philippines 
            has increased significantly from 2000 to 2025, reflecting greater prioritization of human capital and long-term mobility. 
            Second, the strong positive correlation between HFCE and GVA provides evidence that household investment contributes 
            to the economic productivity of the education sector, supporting the rejection of the null hypothesis.
        </p>

        <p>
            Third, while major national crises caused notable declines, these effects were temporary. 
            Education spending showed resilience—recovering quickly after Yolanda and gradually stabilizing following COVID-19. 
            This pattern emphasizes that education remains a protected and essential household expenditure.
        </p>

        <p>
            In conclusion, the long-term upward trend, the strong statistical relationship with economic output, 
            and the recovery after crises collectively show that household investment in education plays a vital role 
            in shaping the sector's contribution to national development. These insights may guide policymakers, 
            educators, and economists in understanding how household behavior supports educational and economic resilience 
            in the Philippines.
        </p>

        <h3>Call to Action</h3>
        <p>
            Given these insights, policymakers, educational institutions, and economic planners should continue strengthening support 
            for households—especially during crises—to maintain the upward trajectory of educational investment.  
            Stakeholders are encouraged to use this data to guide targeted subsidies, expand digital learning access, 
            and develop crisis-proof education policies.  
            Ultimately, sustained and well-supported household spending in education will help secure long-term economic stability 
            and improve the nation's overall learning outcomes.
