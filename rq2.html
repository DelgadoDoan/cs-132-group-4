    <h1>RQ2: Relationship with GVA</h1>
    <p>Correlation tests (Pearson) to explore association between household education spending and GVA (Gross Value Added).</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Nutshell Plot</h2>
      <p>
        The plot above shows the <strong>Quarterly Household Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE) in education</strong> (blue) alongside the <strong>Gross Value Added (GVA)</strong> (orange) in the Philippines from 2000 to 2025. 
        Both indicators demonstrate a strong upward trend over the 25-year period. HFCE increased from approximately <strong>₱70 billion in 2000</strong> to nearly <strong>₱250 billion by 2025</strong>, while GVA grew from around <strong>₱80 billion to ₱275 billion</strong> during the same span.
      </p>
      <p>
        This parallel growth pattern indicates a <strong>high positive association</strong> between household spending on education and the economic value produced by the education sector. 
        The synchronized peaks and troughs suggest that when the education sector expands (as reflected by GVA), household investments in education also intensify, implying a <strong>mutually reinforcing relationship</strong> between educational consumption and production.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notable contractions are observed around <strong>2013</strong>, coinciding with <em>Typhoon Yolanda</em>, and <strong>2020</strong>, during the <em>COVID-19 pandemic</em>. Both events led to short-term dips in expenditure and GVA before steady recovery afterward, highlighting the sector’s sensitivity to major economic shocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the figure illustrates that <strong>education-related spending has grown in lockstep with the sector’s contribution to the national economy</strong>, suggesting that stronger educational investment parallels improved economic performance.

    <section>
      <h2>Data Transformation and Normality</h2>
      <p>
        Prior to correlation testing, both HFCE and GVA variables were <strong>log-transformed</strong> to address skewness and stabilize variance. 
        The histograms above display the <strong>post-log distributions</strong>, which approximate normality more closely than their raw forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Log transformation mitigates the effects of outliers and ensures that the assumptions of <strong>Pearson's correlation</strong>, specifically, linearity and normal distribution, are satisfied.
        This preprocessing step enhances the reliability of correlation results by equalizing scale differences between the two economic indicators.
      </p>
      <p>
        As seen from the smoother bell-shaped patterns, both distributions meet the statistical prerequisites for valid correlation inference.
      </p>

    <!-- Added scatterplots for correlation analysis -->

    <section>
      <h2>Correlation Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        The scatterplots above depict the relationship between <strong>HFCE in education</strong> and <strong>GVA</strong> in both their original (left) and log-transformed (right) scales. 
        A clear upward trend is visible in both plots, confirming a <strong>strong positive correlation</strong>, as GVA increases, so does household expenditure on education.
      </p>
      <p>
        After transformation, the relationship becomes more linear and homoscedastic, indicating that the assumptions of Pearson's correlation test hold true. 
        Statistical testing yields a <strong>correlation coefficient close to +1</strong>, reinforcing that education spending grows proportionally with national economic output.
      </p>
      <p>
        This finding suggests that economic development and educational investment reinforce one another, rising income levels enable greater access to education, which in turn supports long-term productivity growth.

      <h2>Key Findings for RQ2</h2>
      <p><em>[RQ2]</em> To what extent does household expenditure on education correlate with changes in the gross value added (GVA) in education?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>strong positive correlation</strong> was observed between household 
          expenditure on education and the <strong>gross value added (GVA)</strong> 
          in the education sector, indicating that as households invest more in education, 
          the sector's economic output also expands.
        </li>
        <li>
          Periods of <strong>accelerated growth in education GVA</strong> (notably from 
          2015 to 2019 and post-2021) align with <strong>increases in household spending</strong>, 
          suggesting mutual reinforcement between household demand and institutional productivity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Short-term disruptions, such as during the 2020 pandemic, led to a 
          <strong>temporary decoupling</strong> between GVA and household spending, 
          but both indicators recovered rapidly, returning to their upward trajectories by 2022.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Overall:</strong> The findings highlight a 
        <strong>reciprocal relationship</strong> between household expenditure and 
        economic performance in education. Increases in household investment drive 
        sectoral growth, while a thriving education sector, in turn, 
        supports continued household commitment to learning and skills development.
