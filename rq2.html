      <h2>Interpretation</h2>
      <p>
        The graph above compares the <strong>Household Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE) in education</strong> with
        the <strong>Gross Value Added (GVA)</strong> of the Philippines from 2000 to 2025. The two series generally
        move in tandem, showing a strong positive correlation between educational spending and overall economic growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Periods of economic expansion, reflected by increasing GVA, correspond to growth in household spending on education,
        indicating that households tend to invest more in learning when incomes are higher. Conversely, dips during crises
        or slowdowns reflect how vulnerable education budgets are to macroeconomic conditions. This can be seen in the year 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This relationship underscores how education expenditure can both drive and respond to economic development,
        highlighting the interdependence between household welfare and national productivity.

      <h2>Data Transformation and Normality</h2>
      <p>
        Before performing correlation analysis, both variables—HFCE and GVA—were log-transformed to stabilize variance
        and normalize their distributions. The histograms above display the <strong>post-log distributions</strong> for each variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Log transformation reduces skewness and mitigates the impact of outliers, ensuring that the data better meet
        the assumptions of the Pearson correlation test. After transformation, both HFCE and GVA approximate a normal
        distribution, validating the statistical assumptions necessary for accurate correlation analysis.

    <!-- Added scatterplots for correlation analysis -->

<section style="max-width:800px; margin:auto; padding-top:20px; text-align:justify;">
  <h2>Correlation Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    The scatterplots above illustrate the relationship between <strong>HFCE in education</strong> and
    <strong>GVA</strong> in both their original (left) and log-transformed (right) forms. In both cases,
    the points form a clear upward trend, indicating a strong positive correlation between the two variables.
  </p>
  <p>
    The log-transformed plot further emphasizes linearity and homoscedasticity—key assumptions of Pearson’s
    correlation test. This confirms that as national productivity (GVA) increases, household expenditure on
    education also rises proportionally, reinforcing the significant association between economic performance
    and educational investment.
