      <h2>General Trend Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The plot above illustrates the evolution of household spending patterns over time. 
        The data reveal consistent increases in education and healthcare expenditures,
        suggesting a long-term shift toward human capital investment and essential household services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spending on food, housing, and health continues to rise steadily, reflecting both inflationary pressures
        and changing consumption priorities.

      <h2>Category-Level Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        The chart above compares quarterly <strong>Household Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE)</strong> across
        multiple spending categories in the Philippines from 2000 to 2025. Each colored line represents a
        specific sector such as education, health, housing, food, and transport.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among all sectors, <strong>Food and non-alcoholic beverages</strong> stands out as the fastest-growing category,
        surpassing others by a wide margin. This pattern highlights a steady increase in household investment
        toward long-term productivity and skill development. Meanwhile, essentials such as food, housing, and
        healthcare exhibit moderate but stable growth, showing resilience even during economic disruptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The synchronized upward trends across most categories indicate broad-based economic expansion
        and improved household welfare over the study period. However, sharper fluctuations around 2020
        suggest the potential impacts of large-scale crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
