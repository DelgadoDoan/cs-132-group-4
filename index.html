					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<div>
						<p>
							The importance of education towards national development is well-established. It prepares citizens to meet the demands of a rapidly changing world and contribute 
							meaningfully to society. Furthermore, it serves as the gateway for individuals to attain a better quality of life. In the Philippines, where disparities in access 
							to quality education persist, understanding household spending towards education provides valuable insights into broader socio-economic dynamics.
						</p>
						<p>
							This website presents an analysis of household expenditures on education from 2000 to 2025 and explores how these spending patterns relate to the Gross 
							Value Added (GVA) of the education sector in the Philippines. We make use of nationally sourced datasets and perform statistical methods such as time-series 
							analysis to examine long-term trends and causal/interrupted-series methods to examine responses to national economic shocks such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic.
							The results reveal a compelling trend where household spending on education not only correlates strongly with national economic growth, but also 
							demonstrates remarkable elasticity and recovery towards the said major crisis events.

							<h3>Background</h3>
							<p>Education is an important asset in economic and social development.  — it is a decision rooted in aspiration. Each peso invested symbolizes hope, mobility, and the belief that learning can change the trajectory of a family.</p>
							<p>In the Philippines, households play a major role in financing education because of the large presence of private schools and training institutions. This makes household spending a key factor in determining access to education and its overall contribution to the economy. From 2000 to 2025, the Philippines experienced major economic changes, including growth periods, natural disasters, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These events affected how families spent on education and how the education sector contributed to the economy. This study examines whether household investments in education are linked to the sector’s Gross Value Added (GVA) and how spending patterns change during economic shocks.</p>

							<h3>Research topic</h3>
							<p><strong>How has household spending on education changed from 2000 to 2025 and how has this influenced the economic contribution of the education sector in the Philippines?</p></strong>
							<P>This portfolio helps students, researchers, educators, and policymakers visualize how household spending on education changes over time — in both stable periods and national crises. Using time-series trends, correlation analysis, and Interrupted Time Series modeling, it maps the relationship between education expenditures and Gross Value Added (GVA) from 2000 to 2025, revealing strong economic correlation and notable resilience during shocks like Typhoon Yolanda (2013) and COVID-19 (2020).
								Beyond presenting data, it functions as a decision-making tool. The portfolio simplifies economic behavior into visuals, allowing users to ask: <br>
								<br>
								How do households prioritize education? <br>
								How does spending influence economic output? <br>
								How does the sector respond under crisis? <br>

							<h3>Research questions</h3>
							<p>Our research was guided by three central questions — each one building on the last to form a complete picture of how Filipino families invest in education. 
								First, we ask <strong>[RQ1] How have household expenditures on education, relative to other major household spending categories, changed from 2000 to 2025?</strong> 
								This establishes how priorities shift over time. We then explore impact by examining 
								<strong>[RQ2] To what extent does household expenditure on education correlate with changes in the gross value added (GVA) in education?</strong>, 
								allowing us to see whether increased spending contributes to economic output. Finally, we tested resilience through <strong>[RQ3] How did household spending on education change during national economic crises (e.g. 2013 Typhoon Yolanda and 2020 COVID-19)? </strong>, revealing how investment behaves when the system is under crisis.

							<h3>Hypotheses</h3>
							<P>Underlying these questions was our hypothesis: that household spending on education contributes to national economic output. Either this relationship held true — or it didn’t. The analysis that follows allowed the data to answer for itself.</P>
							<p><strong>H0,1:</strong> Household expenditures on education have no significant effect on the GVA in education.<br>
							<strong>HA,1:</strong> Household expenditures on education have a significant effect on the GVA in education.</p>

							<p>
								To examine long-term consumption behavior, time-series analysis and comparative trend analysis were used to track expenditure across education, food, housing, and healthcare. 
								Quarterly HFCE data from 2000–2025 were visualized through multi-category line graphs to observe growth trajectories, seasonal fluctuations, and category dominance over time.
								Tools: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
								
								This method enabled identification of spending priorities and allowed direct comparison between education and other essential categories, revealing upward expenditure movement and shifts in consumption structure over 25 years.

							<h3>RQ2 — HFCE & GVA Relationship</h3>
							<p>
                				To determine whether household expenditures on education are linked to national economic output, Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient was applied to HFCE (education) and Gross Value Added (GVA) time-series.
								
								Prior to testing, both variables underwent normality inspection and log-transformation to correct skewness and satisfy assumptions of linearity and variance stability. 
								Scatterplots were then generated for both raw and log-scaled data, followed by correlation computation.
								Tools: Python (scipy, statsmodels)
								
								This approach measured the strength and direction of association, providing statistical evidence of whether increases in household spending correspond with productivity and expansion in the education sector.

						<p>
							Filipino household spending on education has risen sharply from 2000 to 2025, growing from roughly ₱70 billion to nearly ₱250 billion—despite setbacks during Typhoon Yolanda in 2013 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. 
							Statistical tests showed a strong positive correlation between educational spending and economic output (GVA) in the education sector, indicating that higher household investment aligns with increased sector performance. 
							Interrupted Time-Series Analysis further revealed that while crises caused temporary drops—about ₱4B post-Yolanda and ₱25–30B during COVID—spending later rebounded and continued its upward trajectory. 
							Overall, results suggest that household investment in education is resilient, economically significant, and central to national development. However, the study was limited by national-level data, linear recovery assumptions, and lack of variables like inflation or regional differences. 
							Future research should incorporate more granular data, additional economic indicators, and multivariate forecasting models. Policymakers are encouraged to use these findings to strengthen support systems, 
							develop crisis-resistant education policies, and expand access to learning resources to sustain growth and improve national outcomes.</p>

					<h3>Call to Action</h3>
						<p>
							Given these insights, policymakers, educational institutions, and economic planners should continue strengthening support for households—especially during crises—to maintain the upward trajectory of educational investment. Stakeholders are encouraged to use this data to guide targeted subsidies, expand digital learning access, and develop crisis-proof education policies. Ultimately, sustained and well-supported household spending in education will help secure long-term economic stability and improve the nation's overall learning outcomes.
