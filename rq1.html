      <h2>Distribution of Spending and Economic Output</h2>
      <p>
        The first figure illustrates the distributions of <strong>Household Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE) in education</strong> 
        and <strong>Gross Value Added (GVA)</strong>. Both distributions are <strong>positively skewed</strong>, meaning most values cluster 
        at lower spending levels, with fewer years recording higher expenditures.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <strong>HFCE in education</strong>, the majority of spending values fall between <strong>₱75,000 million and ₱125,000 million</strong>, 
        with a gradual decline in frequency as spending exceeds ₱150,000 million. This indicates that household education spending has 
        historically been concentrated at modest levels but has shown consistent growth in later years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>GVA distribution</strong> follows a similar pattern, with most data points between <strong>₱100,000 million and ₱150,000 million</strong>. 
        The tail toward higher values (up to ₱275,000 million) suggests substantial economic expansion in the education sector 
        and related industries over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, these distributions imply that while education expenditure and value added have steadily grown, the increases 
        are uneven ,  with significant acceleration occurring only in the most recent decade.

      <h2>Category-Level Time Series Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        The second figure presents quarterly <strong>HFCE data from 2000 to 2025</strong> across key consumption categories. 
        The long-term trend reflects consistent economic growth, increasing household spending capacity, 
        and evolving consumption priorities over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The category <strong>Food and non-alcoholic beverages</strong> remains the dominant spending group, 
        rising from approximately <strong>₱450 billion in 2000</strong> to over <strong>₱1.6 trillion by 2025</strong>. 
        This steady climb captures both population growth and inflationary effects, maintaining food as the 
        foundation of Filipino household budgets.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Education</strong> follows a more moderate but stable trajectory, increasing from around 
        <strong>₱70 billion in 2000</strong> to nearly <strong>₱230 billion by 2025</strong>. 
        Notably, slight dips around <strong>2013</strong> (Typhoon Yolanda) and <strong>2020</strong> (COVID-19 pandemic) 
        reflect temporary spending disruptions before recovery resumed, showing the sector's resilience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Health expenditures</strong> also exhibit strong upward growth, climbing from under 
        <strong>₱100 billion in 2000</strong> to around <strong>₱300 billion by 2025</strong>, 
        underscoring increasing household attention to medical needs, preventive care, and aging demographics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other essential sectors, such as <strong>housing, water, and electricity</strong>, display 
        consistent yet moderate increases, aligning with urbanization trends and infrastructure expansion.

      <h2>Key Findings for RQ1</h2>
      <p><em>[RQ1]</em> How have household expenditures on education, relative to other major household spending categories, changed from 2000 to 2025?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Education expenditure</strong> rose significantly from approximately <strong>₱70 billion in 2000</strong> 
          to nearly <strong>₱250 billion by 2025</strong>, an increase of more than <strong>250%</strong>. 
          This growth outpaced that of most other household spending categories, indicating a long-term shift toward 
          prioritizing human capital and educational attainment.
        </li>
        <li>
          While <strong>food and housing</strong> remain the largest components of total household consumption, 
          their proportional share has steadily declined. In contrast, <strong>education, health, and communication</strong> 
          expenditures have grown faster, reflecting an expanding service-oriented consumption pattern among Filipino households.
        </li>
        <li>
          Periods of economic instability, such as <strong>Typhoon Yolanda in 2013</strong> and the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic in 2020</strong>, 
          led to short-term declines in education spending, but these were followed by strong rebounds by <strong>2022-2023</strong>. 
          This indicates that households view education as an essential and resilient expenditure, even during crises.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Overall:</strong> From 2000 to 2025, household spending patterns in the Philippines reveal 
        a clear evolution toward <strong>education-driven and welfare-oriented consumption</strong>. 
        Education has transformed from a secondary expenditure into a major and steadily growing category, 
        suggesting that Filipino households increasingly value long-term social mobility and human capital investment 
        over purely subsistence-based spending.
