    <h1>RQ2: Relationship with GVA</h1>
    <p>Correlation tests (Pearson) to explore association between household education spending and GVA (Gross Value Added).</p>
  </header>

  <main style="text-align:center;">
    <section>
      <p>
        To determine the extent to which household expenditures on education correlate 
        with changes in gross value added (GVA), the following null and alternative hypotheses 
        were formulated: 
      </p>
      <div  style="text-align:center;">
        <h2>Null Hypothesis</h2>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">
          Household expenditures on education have <strong>no significant effect</strong> on the GVA in education.
        </p>
        <h2>Alternative Hypothesis</h2>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">
          Household expenditures on education have <strong>a significant effect</strong> on the GVA in education.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        To test the null hypothesis, <strong>Pearson's correlation test</strong> was used 
        with a confidence level of <strong>95%</strong>. But before doing so, each of the 
        <strong>distributions</strong> of the HFCE and GVA data was inspected to see whether 
        any transformations were necessary to account for <strong>skewness</strong>. This 
        step is important given that Pearson's correlation test <strong>assumes normality</strong> 
        of the data, which ensures the <strong>reliability</strong> of the results.

      <h2>Distribution of Spending and Economic Output</h2>
      <p>
        The first figure illustrates the distributions of <strong>Household Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE) in education</strong> 
        and <strong>Gross Value Added (GVA)</strong>. Both distributions are <strong>positively skewed</strong>, meaning most values cluster 
        at lower spending levels.

    <!-- Added post-log histogram plot -->
    <img src="plots/postlog_dist.png" alt="Post-log HFCE and GVA Distributions" style="max-width:90%; height:auto; margin-top:20px;">
    <section>
      <h2>Data Transformation and Normality</h2>
      <p>
        Both HFCE and GVA variables were <strong>log-transformed</strong> to address skewness and stabilize variance. 
        The histograms above display the <strong>post-log distributions</strong>, which approximate normality more closely than their raw forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Log transformation mitigates the effects of outliers and ensures that the assumptions of <strong>Pearson's correlation</strong>, specifically, linearity and normal distribution, are satisfied.
        This preprocessing step enhances the reliability of correlation results by equalizing scale differences between the two economic indicators.
      </p>
      <p>
        As seen from the smoother bell-shaped patterns, both distributions meet the statistical prerequisites for valid correlation inference.

      <h2>Correlation Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        The scatterplots above depict the relationship between <strong>HFCE in education</strong> and <strong>GVA</strong> in both their original (left) and log-transformed (right) scales. 
        A clear upward trend is visible in both plots, confirming a <strong>strong positive correlation</strong>, as GVA increases, so does household expenditure on education.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pearson's correlation test was assessed on both 
        the original and the log-transformed data. Prior to transformation, the test yielded a correlation 
        coefficient of <strong>0.8863</strong> with a p-value of <strong>3.2554e-35</strong> while 
        post-transformation, it yielded a coefficient of <strong>0.9203</strong> and a p-value of <strong>1.4949e-42.</strong> 
        After transformation, the relationship becomes more linear and homoscedastic, indicating that the 
        assumptions of Pearson's correlation test hold true. 
        Regardless, both cases resulted in a <strong>correlation coefficient close to +1</strong> and an 
        astronomically small <strong>p-value less than α = 0.05</strong>, thereby <strong>rejecting the null 
        hypothesis</strong> and reinforcing that education spending grows proportionally with national economic output.
      </p>
      <p>
        This finding suggests that economic development and educational investment reinforce one another, rising income levels enable greater access to education, which in turn supports long-term productivity growth.

      <h2>Key Findings for RQ2</h2>
      <p><em>[RQ2]</em> To what extent does household expenditure on education correlate with changes in the gross value added (GVA) in education?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>strong positive correlation</strong> was observed between household 
          expenditure on education and the <strong>gross value added (GVA)</strong> 
          in the education sector, indicating that as households invest more in education, 
          the sector's economic output also expands.
        </li>
        <li>
          Periods of <strong>accelerated growth in education GVA</strong> (notably from 
          2015 to 2019 and post-2021) align with <strong>increases in household spending</strong>, 
          suggesting mutual reinforcement between household demand and institutional productivity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Short-term disruptions, such as during the 2020 pandemic, led to a 
          <strong>temporary decoupling</strong> between GVA and household spending, 
          but both indicators recovered rapidly, returning to their upward trajectories by 2022.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Overall:</strong> The findings highlight a 
        <strong>reciprocal relationship</strong> between household expenditure and 
        economic performance in education. Increases in household investment drive 
        sectoral growth, while a thriving education sector, in turn, 
        supports continued household commitment to learning and skills development.
