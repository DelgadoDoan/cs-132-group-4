    <section>
      <h2>Overview of the Plot</h2>
      <p>
        The chart visualizes the <strong>quarterly relationship between Household Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE) in education</strong> 
        and the <strong>Gross Value Added (GVA)</strong> in the Philippines from <strong>2000 to 2025</strong>. 
        It basically captures the dynamic interplay between household spending behavior and the broader economic performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both indicators show an overall <strong>upward trajectory</strong>, reflecting sustained economic growth and increasing 
        household investment in education. The seasonal fluctuations indicate recurring academic and fiscal cycles, 
        while the marked dips correspond to major crises such as <strong>Typhoon Yolanda (2013)</strong> and 
        <strong>COVID-19 (2020)</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Detailed Insights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          From <strong>2000 to 2010</strong>, HFCE in education increased from roughly 
          <strong>₱70 billion</strong> to about <strong>₱120 billion</strong>, showing steady but modest growth 
          consistent with economic expansion and rising enrollment rates.
        </li>
        <li>
          After <strong>2010</strong>, both HFCE and GVA accelerated sharply. By <strong>2025</strong>, 
          HFCE in education reached approximately <strong>₱250 billion</strong>, while GVA exceeded 
          <strong>₱270 billion</strong>. This convergence suggests stronger links between education spending 
          and value creation in the economy.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>2013 Yolanda event</strong> produced a temporary decline in both indicators, 
          with gradual recovery by <strong>2014-2015</strong>. Meanwhile, the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic (2020)</strong> 
          caused a more pronounced but short-lived contraction, highlighting education's vulnerability to 
          large-scale disruptions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Post-2020, spending rebounded rapidly, implying adaptation through digital learning and continued 
          prioritization of education despite global uncertainty.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Key Findings</h2>
      <p>
        The parallel movements of <strong>HFCE in education</strong> and <strong>GVA</strong> indicate a 
        <strong>strong positive relationship</strong> between household education spending and economic activity.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Education is both reactive and resilient</strong>, such that spending falls during crises but rebounds quickly, showing recovery capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-term alignment with GVA</strong> implies that education expenditure scales with national productivity and household income levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-crisis rebounds</strong> reinforce education's role as a critical investment in economic and social stability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Overall, this plot summarizes the entire 25-year trajectory of education spending and its macroeconomic counterpart, 
        providing a “nutshell view” of how Filipino households invest in human capital as the economy grows and faces challenges.
