    <h1>RQ3: Crisis Impact</h1>
    <p>Interrupted Time-Series Analysis (ITSA) to evaluate how major crises, such as Typhoon Yolanda (2013) and COVID-19 (2020), disrupted household spending on education in the Philippines.</p>

      <h2>Interrupted Time-Series Analysis (ITSA)</h2>
      <p>
        The graph above illustrates the <strong>Household Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE) in education</strong> from <strong>2000 to 2025</strong>, 
        modeled through an <strong>Interrupted Time-Series (ITS) framework</strong> utilizing <strong>Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression</strong> 
        to examine the effects of two key crises: <strong>Typhoon Yolanda (2013)</strong> and the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic (2020)</strong>. 
        The <span style=" background: linear-gradient(to right, #2b3272, #a2cb90); -webkit-background-clip: text;-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;"><strong>
        gradient blue-green line</strong></span> shows the HFCE in education over time, while the <span style="color:#a6cee3;"><strong>light blue line</strong></span> 
        represents the regression lines obtained from the model, one for before, during, and after each crisis. The dotted line marks Yolanda's onset (2013), and the 
        dashed line marks the COVID-19 pandemic's start (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
        Between <strong>2000 and 2013</strong>, the average household spending on education increased steadily from approximately 
        <strong>₱65-70 billion</strong> to around <strong>₱115-120 billion</strong>, reflecting expanding educational participation and rising household income. 
        Seasonal fluctuations are visible, likely corresponding to enrollment cycles, but the long-term trajectory was strongly upward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following <strong>Typhoon Yolanda (2013)</strong>, the trend shows a <strong>minor but clear slowdown</strong>. 
        The model estimates a temporary deviation of about <strong>₱4 billion</strong> below the projected spending line, 
        attributed to the disaster's economic displacement and household reprioritization toward recovery essentials. 
        However, recovery was rapid—by <strong>2015</strong>, education spending had realigned with its pre-crisis trajectory, 
        suggesting effective reconstruction measures and strong household commitment to schooling despite hardship.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>COVID-19 pandemic (2020)</strong> caused a <strong>sharper and more prolonged disruption</strong>. 
        Observed spending dropped abruptly by roughly <strong>₱25-30 billion</strong> relative to the expected trend, 
        the steepest decline in the entire time series.
        This drop coincides with nationwide lockdowns, temporary school closures, and the shift to remote learning, 
        which reduced immediate household expenses on tuition, transport, and materials. 
        The ITS model indicates a gradual recovery beginning in <strong>2022</strong>, with the HFCE projected to rise back toward 
        <strong>₱225-230 billion</strong> by <strong>2025</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, both crises interrupted the otherwise consistent upward trend in education HFCE, but with differing magnitudes and durations. 
        Yolanda's effects were short-term and localized, while COVID-19 produced a nationwide, multi-year contraction with slower recovery. 
        Yet, by 2025, spending levels nearly return to the trajectory projected without intervention, indicating strong long-term resilience of education-related household investment.

      <h2>Key Findings for RQ3</h2>
      <p><em>[RQ3]</em> How did household spending on education change during national economic crises (e.g. 2013 Typhoon Yolanda and 2020 Covid-19 pandemic)?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Typhoon Yolanda (2013)</strong> caused a <strong>temporary decline of ₱4 billion</strong> in education HFCE, 
          reflecting short-lived disruptions in schooling and regional economic priorities. Recovery occurred within two years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>COVID-19 (2020)</strong> led to a <strong>major contraction of approximately ₱25-30 billion</strong> in education spending, 
          with effects lasting through 2021 due to extended lockdowns and learning disruptions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Post-crisis recovery trends show a return to pre-intervention levels by <strong>2023-2025</strong>, 
          with projected HFCE reaching about <strong>₱230 billion</strong>. This underscores the 
          <strong>resilience and long-term prioritization</strong> of education by Filipino households.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ITS model confirms that <strong>crisis impacts were significant but non-permanent</strong>, 
          suggesting that education remains a protected and high-priority expenditure even amid economic shocks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Overall:</strong> National crises caused measurable but temporary downturns in household education spending. 
        The long-term trend shows strong recovery and sustained growth, reinforcing the idea that Filipino households 
        view education as both an essential need and a strategic investment for post-crisis economic stability.
