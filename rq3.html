      <h2>Interpretation</h2>
      <p>
        The figure above displays the <strong>Household Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE) in education</strong> from 2000 to 2025,
        modeled using an Interrupted Time Series (ITS) approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Noticeable breaks appear around <strong>2013</strong> and <strong>2020</strong> — corresponding to <strong>Typhoon Yolanda</strong>
        and the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong>, respectively. After Yolanda, a short-term dip was followed by recovery and continued growth,
        whereas COVID-19 caused a more sustained disturbance in spending behavior before normalization resumed.
      </p>
      <p>
        These interruptions highlight how large-scale crises can temporarily alter education spending trends, emphasizing the need
        for resilient household expenditure strategies and stronger government support mechanisms.
